gdiff
=====

Exports the changed files from a git repository between two commits.
I use this for keeping websites up-to-date over ftp, so I have to 
upload only the changed files.

The script also creates a TO_DELETE.lst file to the output directory.


Usage (from a git repo):
========================

/path/to/gdiff -o /tmp/project

This command exports the files from the last commit to /tmp/project.

/path/to/gdiff -o /tmp/project v1.0

Copy the changed files since v1.0 to /tmp/project.


Caveats:
========

The script always takes the version of a file from the working copy!
